# Setting up a robot simulation (Gazebo)[](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#setting-up-a-robot-simulation-gazebo "Link to this heading")


## [Prerequisites](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#id1)[](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#prerequisites "Link to this heading")

First of all you should install ROS 2 and Gazebo. You have two options:

> - Install from deb packages. To check which versions are available from deb packages please check this [table](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_ign).
>     
> - Compile from sources:
>     
>     - [ROS 2 install instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
>         
>     - [Gazebo install instructions](https://gazebosim.org/docs)
>         

## [Tasks](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#id2)[](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#tasks "Link to this heading")

### [1 Launch the simulation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#id3)[](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#launch-the-simulation "Link to this heading")

In this demo you are going to simulate a simple diff drive robot in Gazebo. You are going to use one of the worlds defined in the Gazebo examples called [visualize_lidar.sdf](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/blob/main/examples/worlds/visualize_lidar.sdf). To run this example you should execute the following command in a terminal:

```bash
ign gazebo -v 4 -r visualize_lidar.sdf
```


![../../../../_images/gazebo_diff_drive.png](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/_images/gazebo_diff_drive.png)

When the simulation is running you can check the topics provided by Gazebo with the `ign` command line tool:


```bash
ign topic -l
```
/clock
/gazebo/resource_paths
/gui/camera/pose
/gui/record_video/stats
/model/vehicle_blue/odometry
/model/vehicle_blue/tf
/stats
/world/visualize_lidar_world/clock
/world/visualize_lidar_world/dynamic_pose/info
/world/visualize_lidar_world/pose/info
/world/visualize_lidar_world/scene/deletion
/world/visualize_lidar_world/scene/info
/world/visualize_lidar_world/state
/world/visualize_lidar_world/stats

Since you have not launched an ROS 2 nodes yet, the output from `ros2 topic list` should be free of any robot topics:

```bash
ros2 topic list
```
/parameter_events
/rosout

### [2 Configuring ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#id4)[](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#configuring-ros-2 "Link to this heading")

To be able to communicate our simulation with ROS 2 you need to use a package called `ros_gz_bridge`. This package provides a network bridge which enables the exchange of messages between ROS 2 and Gazebo Transport. You can install this package by typing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ros-ign-bridge
```

At this point you are ready to launch a bridge from ROS to Gazebo. In particular you are going to create a bridge for the topic `/model/vehicle_blue/cmd_vel`:



```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge model/vehicle_blue/cmd_vel@geometry_msgs/msg/Twist]ignition.msgs.Twist
```

For more details about the `ros_gz_bridge` please check this [README](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/tree/ros2/ros_gz_bridge) .

Once the bridge is running the robot is able to follow your motor commands. There are two options:

- Send a command to the topic using `ros2 topic pub`
    

> 
```bash
ros2 topic pub /model/vehicle_blue/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear: { x: 0.1 }"
```

- `teleop_twist_keyboard` package. This node takes keypresses from the keyboard and publishes them as Twist messages. You can install it typing:
    

> 
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard
```
> 
> The default topic where `teleop_twist_keyboard` is publishing Twist messages is `/cmd_vel` but you can remap this topic to make use of the topic used in the bridge:
> 
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r /cmd_vel:=/model/vehicle_blue/cmd_vel
```
> This node takes keypresses from the keyboard and publishes them
> as Twist messages. It works best with a US keyboard layout.

### [3 Visualizing lidar data in ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#id5)[](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html#visualizing-lidar-data-in-ros-2 "Link to this heading")

The diff drive robot has a lidar. To send the data generated by Gazebo to ROS 2, you need to launch another bridge. In the case the data from the lidar is provided in the Gazebo Transport topic `/lidar2`, which you are going to remap in the bridge. This topic will be available under the topic `/lidar_scan`:



```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge lidar2@sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan[ignition.msgs.LaserScan --ros-args -r /lidar2:=/laser_scan
```

To visualize the data from the lidar in ROS 2 you can use Rviz2:



```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
rviz2
```

Then you need to configure the `fixed frame`:

![../../../../_images/fixed_frame.png](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/_images/fixed_frame.png)

And then click in the button “Add” to include a display to visualize the lidar:

![../../../../_images/add_lidar.png](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/_images/add_lidar.png)

Now you should see the data from the lidar in Rviz2:
